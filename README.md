#RPG Game
This game prompts you to choose a character to play as, then choose a character to fight against. When you click Fight, it decreases both your Health and the defender's Health. Every time your character battles, their attack gets stronger. If your health is reduced to 0 or below, you lose. If the defender's health is reduced to 0 or below, they are defeated and you can choose the next defender. If you defeat all three defenders, you win the game!
